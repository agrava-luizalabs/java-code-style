### Java Style Guide

This document describes the Java coding style guide used by Luizalabs teams, it was based on the [Google Guide](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javaguide.html) and [Java Ranch Guide](http://www.javaranch.com/styleLong.jsp), but we used it just to create insights, so for a perfect understanding it is recommended to read this entire document. The reading should be easy, because it was designed to be a concise and easy to read guide.
