###Setup

To install the code style on IntelliJ just run the shell script `install.sh`. 
<br>
It is important to remember that you must run `install.sh` from `setup/Intellij`, the script will look for all `\*.xml` files and copy that to yours IntelliJ preferences folder

```sh
$ cd java-code-style/setup/intellij
$ ./install.sh
```
